## Below are the learnings from this project:

This project focuses on learning modern technologies and best practices in software development through building a hands-on web application. It incorporates the 12-Factor App methodology, Agile development practices, and integrates various advanced tools and frameworks.

Key technologies integrated include:

FastAPI: A high-performance Python web framework for building APIs, supporting async programming and type hinting.
SQLAlchemy: An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) toolkit for database management in Python.
PostgreSQL: A robust, open-source object-relational database system.
MinIO: A high-performance, Kubernetes-native object storage solution compatible with Amazon S3 API, used for storing user profile pictures.
OAuth2: An authorization protocol for implementing secure user authentication and access management.
Docker: Containerization technology for packaging applications with dependencies for consistent environments.
Alembic: A database migration tool for safely evolving database schemas in team settings.
Pytest: A testing framework for writing and maintaining test cases, enabling CI/CD workflows.
Pydantic: A library for data parsing and validation using Python type annotations, ensuring data integrity.

The project emphasizes setting up development environments with Docker, managing application lifecycle with Git, automating deployments with CI/CD pipelines, and monitoring application performance and health.
